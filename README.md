# HireSense

**AI-Powered Resume Intelligence & Career Path Recommendation System**

HireSense is a semantic AI-driven resume analysis platform that goes beyond traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Instead of relying on keyword matching, HireSense uses transformer-based language models to deeply understand resumes — extracting skills, technologies, and project experience while generating personalized learning and career transition paths.

Built for campus placement drives, HR teams, and working professionals, HireSense enables smarter hiring, skill gap analysis, and long-term career development.
